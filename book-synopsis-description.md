### Bobo: Against the Pod

In a world where dogs and cats intermarry, it's not so unusual for Bobo the whale to fall in love with a dolphin. At
least they're not separated by the shoreline. They do, however, have to contend with the overzealous captain of the
world's largest fishing vessel as it races to become the most productive, self-contained processing vehicle of all time.

Will Captain Mike capture and convert Bobo into motor oil, fish sticks, and cosmetics? Will the love of his life wind
up in a tuna net? The next 48 hours will decide their ultimate fate ... and that of the world!
