When you first retrieve the [leanpub-jekyll](https://github.com/groundh0g/leanpub-jekyll) project files, there will already be a `manuscript` folder with four chapters. The chapters contain examples of markdown and they showcase the structure of a Leanpub book. This text was written by [Len Epp](https://leanpub.com/u/lenepp), and is freely available from the Leanpub website [here](https://leanpub.com/sample-leanpub-markdown-book).

I made the following changes:

* I added an `index.md` file to generate the page that you're reading right now. This file will be ignored by Leanpub since it's not referenced by the `Book.txt` file.
* I added a `fluff.md` file to contain the paragraphs you're reading right now. This file will be ignored by Leanpub since it's not referenced by the `Book.txt` file. Don't forget to clear out the `fluff.md` text when you're ready to host your site.
* I added a `draft.md` file to stitch the book's chapters together into a single web page. This file will be ignored by Leanpub since it's not referenced by the `Book.txt` file.
* I renamed the chapter files from `*.txt` to `*.md` and updated the references to same within the `Book.txt` file.
* I added YAML headers to each chapter. These help the site display separate chapters as separate web pages, and that header should be safely ignored by the Leanpub publishing process.
* I added a fourth chapter with "lorem ipsum" text as a placeholder. The content doesn't matter. You'll replace all four chapters with your own text, and add new chapters after that.
* I created a bogus, completely unrelated, book cover to show alongside the synopsis. Consider it a placeholder for you to swap out for your own cover.

**REMEMBER:** Be sure to clear out this text (in `fluff.md`) when you get your book up and running. Your readers don't care how this site was built. =)
